# The Law of Minimal Description

**A simple informational bias â€” toward shorter descriptions â€” reproduces gravity, orbits, inverse-square law behavior, and clustering without any force postulates.**

This project proposes a single physical principle:

> **The universe evolves toward states of shorter description.**  
> **Î”Î¦ â‰¤ 0** â€” *The Law of Minimal Description*

From this alone, using **description length minimization** (Kolmogorov complexity / MDL style), we show:

âœ… Gravity emerges from **spatial compression gradients**  
âœ… Newtonâ€™s inverse-square law arises from **informational flux conservation**  
âœ… Binary orbits appear **without assuming force or momentum**  
âœ… Many-body gravitational clustering occurs naturally  
âœ… Quantum probability (Born rule) follows from **compression weighting**  
âœ… Time and causality emerge from **temporal compression**  
âœ… General Relativity follows from **second variations of Î¦**

### ðŸ§ª Reproducible Simulations

All simulations use **Î¦-descent** via a Metropolis process minimizing **total description length** approximated by a **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)** encoding cost.

Run figures (quick mode):

```bash
make figures-fast

## Reproducing paper figures

```bash
# 1) install
make setup

# 2) regenerate all figures deterministically
make figures        # or: make figures-fast
